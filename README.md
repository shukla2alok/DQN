# **Food Delivery Optimization with DQN and OSRM**

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** solution to optimize food delivery operations. Using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**, the system assigns orders to riders, and **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** calculates the shortest delivery routes. The project includes data preprocessing, RL training, route visualization, and performance evaluation.

---

## **Features**
- **Order Assignment:** Uses a trained DQN model to assign orders to the most suitable riders.
- **Route Optimization:** Leverages OSRM to compute the shortest delivery routes.
- **Visualization:** Plots riders, orders, and optimized delivery routes on a map.
- **Custom RL Environment:** Models the food delivery problem using OpenAI Gym.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Simulates orders and rider locations.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DQN.git
   cd DQN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the `requirements.txt` file to install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   Run the script to create sample `orders.csv` and `riders.csv`:
   ```bash
   python src/synthetic_data.py
   ```

4. **Train the RL Model**:
   Train the DQN model for rider assignment:
   ```bash
   python src/train_rl.py
   ```

5. **Visualize Routes**:
   Plot the optimized delivery routes:
   ```bash
   python src/visualization.py
   ```

---

## **Key Scripts**
- **`rl_environment.py`**: Defines the custom RL environment for food delivery optimization.
- **`train_rl.py`**: Trains the DQN model and saves it as `trained_model.h5`.
- **`evaluate.py`**: Evaluates the trained model on test data.
- **`synthetic_data.py`**: Generates synthetic data for riders and orders.
- **`visualization.py`**: Visualizes optimized delivery routes using OSRM.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.13.0
- pandas
- matplotlib
- requests
- geopy
- OpenAI Gym

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Results**
- The optimized routes are saved as a PNG file (`rider_routes.png`) in the `src` folder.
- Visualized routes include rider locations, order locations, and their shortest paths.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integrate dynamic rider availability and traffic data into the RL environment.
- Extend the RL environment for multi-objective optimization (e.g., fuel costs, delivery times).
- Use real-world delivery data for improved model performance.
